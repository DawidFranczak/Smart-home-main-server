
# About the project 
**Smart home** is a project that allows controlling certain elements of a house through a website.

 
**The project includes management of** : 
* sunblinds, 
* indoor lighting,
* cascading stair lighting,
* aquarium lighting,
* outdoor lighting,
* opening doors/gates using magnetic cards,
* periodic temperature measurements.

To check the functionality of the website, you can create an account with the suffix **"tester"**.
Then three devices of each type and random temperature
values from the last 8 days will be assigned. Devices with the name "tester" are "connected" to a physical device.


## Website

The website is bilingual. The default language is English, but if the browser language is set to Polish, the website will be displayed in Polish.
